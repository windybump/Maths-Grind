Maths Grind: A clean and efficient website to practice arithmetic

Get Started
1) Go to the website: https://mathsgrind.com/
2) Get grinding!

The motivation:
If you look up "times table practice" on a search engine you usually find websites which are targeted towards very young children. I wanted to make a version for older people who just want a simple way to improve their mental arithmetic.
